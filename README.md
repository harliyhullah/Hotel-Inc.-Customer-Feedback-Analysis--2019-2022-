## Introduction: Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of guest feedback collected by Hotel Inc. between 2019 and 2022. Using Microsoft Excel, I transformed raw customer experience data into actionable insights to improve service quality, enhance guest satisfaction, and support strategic decision-making. Although the hotel received favorable ratings overall, consistent negative feedback in key service areas like food variety and room cleanliness suggested the need for focused operational improvements.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to:

Identify the distribution and size of customer segments  
Compare feedback scores across guest demographics  
Reveal behavioral patterns based on age, visit purpose, and discovery channel  
Highlight performance across service areas such as food, cleanliness, and staff  
Provide data-driven recommendations to elevate the guest experience

## Methodology

This project followed a structured Excel-based workflow with the following phases

### Data Cleaning

Removed irrelevant and empty columns  
Standardized column names  
Checked for missing and duplicate values  
Ensured appropriate data types for dates, numbers, and text

### Data Transformation

Calculated stay duration and age from raw dates  
Created categories such as age group, stay type, and check-in season  
Converted qualitative ratings to numeric using reference tables  
Computed average service experience per guest

### Pivot Table Analysis

Created six pivot tables to extract insights on  
Overall rating distribution  
Purpose of visit  
Age category  
Discovery channel  
Service ratings  
Seasonal trends
