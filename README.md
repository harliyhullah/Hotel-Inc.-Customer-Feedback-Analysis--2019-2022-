## Introduction: Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of guest feedback collected by Hotel Inc. between 2019 and 2022. Using Microsoft Excel, I transformed raw customer experience data into actionable insights to improve service quality, enhance guest satisfaction, and support strategic decision-making. Although the hotel received favorable ratings overall, consistent negative feedback in key service areas like food variety and room cleanliness suggested the need for focused operational improvements.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to:

1. Identify the distribution and size of customer segments
2. Compare feedback scores across guest demographics
3. Reveal behavioral patterns based on age, visit purpose, and discovery channel
4. Highlight performance across service areas such as food, cleanliness, and staff
5. Provide data-driven recommendations to elevate the guest experience

## Methodology

This project followed a structured Excel-based workflow with the following phases

### Data Cleaning

- Removed irrelevant and empty columns
- Standardized column names
- Checked for missing and duplicate values
- Ensured appropriate data types for dates, numbers, and text

### Data Transformation

- Calculated stay duration and age from raw dates
- Created categories such as age group, stay type, and check-in season
- Converted qualitative ratings to numeric using reference tables
- Computed average service experience per guest

### Pivot Table Analysis

Created six pivot tables to extract insights on  
- Overall rating distribution
- Purpose of visit
- Age category
- Discovery channel
- Service ratings
- Seasonal trends

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel  
Pivot Tables and Slicers  
Formulas including IF, INDEX-MATCH, YEARFRAC  
Conditional Formatting and Charts
